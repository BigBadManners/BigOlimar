# BigOlimar
A small (and currently incomplete) Rust binary containing an abstraction of how Olimar's Pikmin lineup works in Smash Ultimate.

The aim of this project is to create an application that can visualise all the mechanics of Olimar's lineup - plucking, throwing, dying, attack cancelling, and so on; and to be able to use this application to visualise certain computer science concepts such as Big O notation.
